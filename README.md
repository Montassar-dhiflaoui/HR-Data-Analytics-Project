**HR Data Analytics Project**
This project focuses on HR data analytics using Power BI and Python. The primary goal was to extract, transform, and load (ETL) HR-related data into a PostgreSQL data warehouse and create dynamic visualizations to derive key insights.

**Project Overview :**

**Data Analysis**

- The project began with an in-depth analysis of the data to design the data warehouse structure and logic.

**Data Warehousing**

- The data warehouse design was implemented in PostgreSQL, providing a robust foundation for storing and managing the data.

**Data Manipulation**

- Python was used to transform and prepare the data, ensuring its readiness for analysis. The transformed data was then loaded into the PostgreSQL data warehouse.

**Visualizations**

- Using Power BI, dynamic dashboards were developed to offer key insights derived from the data.

**Key Components**

- Data Analysis: Analysis to understand data requirements and design the warehouse structure.
- Data Warehousing: PostgreSQL database setup and schema design.
- Data Manipulation: Python scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and loading.
- Visualizations: Power BI dashboards for data visualization and insights.

**Technologies Used**

- Python: For data transformation and manipulation.
- PostgreSQL: For data storage and management.
- Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
